## Installation

Install the vehicle spawner by copying the following files into a new folder (name it what ever you want)
- [client]
  - client.lua
  - config.lua
  - utils.lua
  - vehicleList.lua
- [web]
  - build
- fxmanifest.lua

#### Once done move this folder into your 'resources' folder. Don't forget to update your server.cfg! 
## Documentation

There are several options that can be changed inside of the config.lua file. Feel free to familiarise yourself with this. You're able to change the spawn key, add static locations etc.

To change the vehicle list simply make your changes inside the VehicleDictionary.lua file. Not the ID's must be the exact ID's within FiveM and or your custom vehicles within your resources. 

Whilst in game simply press F6(default) and a form will open allowing you to spawn your vehicle! Your previous vehicle will be deleted as the new one is created, so you can spawn a car, whilst already inside of one.

To escape the vehicle spawn menu simply press 'esc' or 'backspace'.

Remember to restart vehicle-spanwer in your F8 console should you make any changes whilst your server is live.
