## Installation

Install the loadsout menu by copying the following files into a new folder (name it what ever you want)
- [client]
  - client.lua
  - config.lua
  - utils.lua
  - eupList.lua
  - serviceList.lua
  - loadoutsList.lua
- [web]
  - build
- fxmanifest.lua

#### Once done move this folder into your 'resources' folder. Don't forget to update your server.cfg! 
## Documentation

To make changes reference the eupList, serviceList and loadoutsList. Be sure to update the ID's in all files in order for the script to work correctly.

To escape the menu simply press 'esc' or 'backspace'. Default to open is F6 (this can be changed).

Remember to restart loadouts menu in your F8 console should you make any changes whilst your server is live.
